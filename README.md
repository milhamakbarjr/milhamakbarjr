# Junior Akbar

Product designer and frontend engineer with 4+ years building financial and education software. I work across the full stack of product development—from research and design systems to shipping production code.

## What I do

I design and build web and mobile products, mostly in fintech and SaaS. My background spans individual contributor work, team leadership, and contributing to open source. I care about accessibility, clear interfaces, and systems that scale without breaking.

**Design:** Product design, UX research, design systems
**Engineering:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
**Tools:** Figma for design, Git for everything else

## Projects

**[Biome Design System](https://www.milhamakbarjr.com/works/project-biome)** — Design system for Bareksa's fintech platform. Built component libraries, documentation, and tooling that reduced design-to-dev handoff time and improved UI consistency.

**[Bareksa Stock](https://www.milhamakbarjr.com/works/project-bareksa-stock)** — Mobile trading app for the Indonesian market. Designed and shipped features for stock screening, portfolio tracking, and market analysis.

**[Skool](https://www.milhamakbarjr.com/works/project-skool)** — Education SaaS that works offline. Built for schools in areas with unreliable internet—handles syncing, conflict resolution, and graceful degradation.

**[AppInsight](https://uxtools-appinsight.vercel.app/)** — Open-source tool that analyzes Google Play reviews to extract UX insights. Next.js + TypeScript.
